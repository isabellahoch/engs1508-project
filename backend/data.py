      "reasoning": "# STEP 1 OUTPUT:\n The Aerospace and Defense industry, as per the provided sector-specific guidance, has unique characteristics that warrant special consideration in financial analysis. Core ratios, such as those related to revenue, profitability, and leverage, are crucial for assessing the financial health of companies in this sector. However, given the industry's nature, supplemental ratios like Free Operating Cash Flow to debt (FOCF to debt), debt service coverage ratios, and Discretionary Cash Flow to debt (DCF to debt) are also important. These supplemental ratios help refine the understanding of a company's credit risk profile and cash flow, especially when developing new products.\n # STEP 2 OUTPUT:\n Based on the given information, let's determine the financial risk profile for KBR Inc. following the general corporate methodology and the industry-specific guidance for the Aerospace and Defense industry.\n\nStep 2A: Comparing core ratios -\n1. FFO to debt: Aggressive Risk [5]\n2. Debt to EBITDA: Intermediate Risk [3]\n\nAccording to the industry-specific guidance, FFO to debt is a crucial ratio for the Aerospace and Defense industry. Therefore, we will consider FFO to debt as the relevant core ratio.\n\nStep 2B: Considering supplementary ratios -\n1. FOCF to debt: Significant Risk [4]\n2. DCF to debt: Minimal Risk [1]\n\nBased on the industry-specific guidance, FOCF to debt and DCF to debt are essential supplemental ratios for the Aerospace and Defense industry. Since these two ratios indicate different cash flow/leverage assessments, we need to select the relevant supplemental ratio. In this case, we will choose FOCF to debt as it provides a better indicator of a company's future leverage, given the industry's nature of developing new products and requiring significant capital expenditures.\n\nNow, we will adjust the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment based on the selected supplemental ratio, FOCF to debt (Significant Risk [4]). The preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment was Aggressive Risk [5] based on the FFO to debt ratio. After considering the supplemental ratio, we will adjust the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment down by one category to Significant Risk [4].\n\nTherefore, the financial risk profile for KBR Inc. is a Significant Risk [4].\n # FINAL ANSWER OUTPUT:\n Based on the information provided, here is the JSON object with the 'reasoning' and 'answer' fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The financial risk profile for KBR Inc. is determined by comparing core ratios and considering supplementary ratios, as per the general corporate methodology and the industry-specific guidance for the Aerospace and Defense industry. The core ratio, FFO to debt, indicates an Aggressive Risk [5]. However, considering the industry-specific guidance, we focus on the supplemental ratio FOCF to debt, which shows a Significant Risk [4]. After adjusting the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment based on the selected supplemental ratio, the final financial risk profile for KBR Inc. is a Significant Risk [4].\",\n  \"answer\": 4\n}\n```"
