OUTPUT:\\n\\n   Based on the information provided, the appropriate volatility table to use for Walt Disney Co. (The) is the Medial Volatility table (table 18). This is because the company has a CICRA score of \\'3\\', which generally applies the medial volatility table. Furthermore, the company operates in the MEDIA & ENTERTAINMENT industry, which is not identified as having low volatility. Therefore, the medial volatility table is the most suitable for this assessment.\\n # STEP 2 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the provided context, let\\'s categorize each financial metric into its corresponding risk category using the Medial Volatility Table:\\n\\nCore Financial Metrics:\\n1. FFO to debt: 0.27 -> Significant Risk (13% - 23%)\\n2. Debt to EBITDA: 2.4 -> Intermediate Risk (2.5 - 3.5)\\n\\nSupplemental financial metrics:\\n1. FFO cash interest cover: 6.4 -> Modest Risk (7.5 - 10.5)\\n2. EBITDA to interest: 8.28 -> Minimal Risk (greater than or equal to 14)\\n3. CFO to debt: 0.36 -> Intermediate Risk (18.5% - 27.5%)\\n4. FOCF to debt: 0.22 -> Intermediate Risk (9.5% - 17.5%)\\n5. DCF to debt: 0.22 -> Intermediate Risk (6.5% - 11%)\\n\\nOther metrics:\\n1. EBIT margin: 11.6% -> Not provided in the tables\\n2. EBITDA margin: 17.5% -> Not provided in the tables\\n3. Return on capital: 4.14 -> Not provided in the tables\\n4. CICRA: [3] Intermediate risk -> Already categorized\\n\\nPlease note that EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and Return on capital are not provided in the tables, so they cannot be categorized.\\n # STEP 3 OUTPUT:\\n The Media and Entertainment industry has specific guidelines for supplemental and core metrics in its financial analysis. Core ratios include the cash flow-to-leverage ratio, which is used as a preliminary indicator. If this ratio is intermediate or better, the following supplemental ratios are frequently used: Free Operating Cash Flow (FOCF) to debt (for capital intensive companies), Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) to debt (for working capital intensive companies), and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) to debt (for companies with significant dividends or unique revenue/cost recognition practices). \\n\\nIf the preliminary cash flow-to-leverage ratio is significant or weaker, interest coverage ratios are given greater weight. For U.S. local TV stations, an additional supplemental ratio is considered: debt to average trailing eight quarters\\' average EBITDA. \\n\\nFree Operating Cash Flow (FOCF) to debt is often used as the supplemental cash flow to leverage ratio for media and entertainment companies due to the common practice of recognizing revenue when services are performed, but cash collections may span several years. This timing difference can affect the accuracy of profitability metrics. \\n\\nThese adjustments are routine and consistent with the four adjustment principles. They are designed to account for unique industry characteristics such as the timing of revenue recognition, the diversity in expense recognition practices, and the impact of significant events like elections or the Olympics on local TV stations\\' financials.\\n # STEP 4 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the information provided and following the steps outlined, let\\'s determine the financial risk profile for Walt Disney Co. (The).\\n\\nStep 4A: Comparing core ratios, we have FFO to debt at 0.27, which falls into the \\'Significant Risk\\' category (13% - 23%). The debt to EBITDA ratio is 2.4, which is in the \\'Intermediate Risk\\' category (2.5 - 3.5). Given the industry-specific guidance, we\\'ll use FFO to debt as it\\'s a better indicator of a company\\'s future leverage in the Media & Entertainment industry.\\n\\nStep 4B: Now, let\\'s consider the supplementary ratios. The important ones for the Media & Entertainment industry are FFO cash interest cover, FOCF to debt, and CFO to debt. \\n\\n1. FFO cash interest cover is 6.4, which is in the \\'Modest Risk\\' category (7.5 - 10.5).\\n2. FOCF to debt is 0.22, which is in the \\'Intermediate Risk\\' category (9.5% - 17.5%).\\n3. CFO to debt is 0.36, also in the \\'Intermediate Risk\\' category (18.5% - 27.5%).\\n\\nThe cash flow/leverage assessment indicated by the important supplemental ratios (FOCF to debt and CFO to debt) is \\'Intermediate Risk\\'. This differs from the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment of \\'Significant Risk\\' based on FFO to debt. \\n\\nGiven that FOCF to debt and CFO to debt provide a better overall indicator of a company\\'s future leverage in the Media & Entertainment industry, we will adjust the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment. Therefore, the adjusted cash flow/leverage assessment is \\'Intermediate Risk\\'.\\n\\nConsidering the company\\'s business risk profile, we classify Walt Disney Co. (The) as stable for these cash flow criteria. The final cash flow/leverage assessment for these companies will not be modified from the adjusted cash flow/leverage assessment.\\n\\nTherefore, the financial risk profile for Walt Disney Co. (The) is \\'Intermediate Risk\\' (3).\\n # STEP 5 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the analysis of Walt Disney Co.\\'s financial metrics and considering the industry-specific guidance for the Media & Entertainment industry, the company\\'s financial risk profile is determined to be \\'Intermediate Risk\\' (3).\\n\\nThe \\'reasoning\\' behind this answer is as follows:\\n\\n1. Core financial metrics were evaluated, with FFO to debt being 0.27, categorized as \\'Significant Risk\\'. Debt to EBITDA was 2.4, falling into the \\'Intermediate Risk\\' category. Following industry-specific guidance, FFO to debt was considered the better indicator for future leverage in the Media & Entertainment industry.\\n\\n2. Supplemental ratios were assessed, focusing on FFO cash interest cover, FOCF to debt, and CFO to debt. The \\'Modest Risk\\' FFO cash interest cover was 6.4, while both FOCF to debt and CFO to debt were \\'Intermediate Risk\\' at 0.22 and 0.36, respectively.\\n\\n3. Cash flow/leverage assessment based on important supplemental ratios (FOCF to debt and CFO to debt) showed \\'Intermediate Risk\\', which differed from the preliminary \\'Significant Risk\\' assessment based on FFO to debt. Considering the company\\'s business risk profile, Walt Disney Co. (The) was classified as stable for these cash flow criteria.\\n\\n4. Consequently, the final cash flow/leverage assessment for Walt Disney Co. (The) is \\'Intermediate Risk\\' (3).\\n\\nIn summary, the {\\'reasoning\\': <Methodological explanation as to why you chose that specific rating>, \\'answer\\': <A single category from 1-6> } is:\\n\\n{\\'reasoning\\': \\'Based on the analysis of Walt Disney Co.’s financial metrics and industry-specific guidance, the company’s financial risk profile is determined to be \"Intermediate Risk\" (3) due to its FFO to debt ratio, FOCF to debt ratio, and CFO to debt ratio.\\', \\'answer\\':
