0.18 falls into the Intermediate Risk category (30-45%).\\nDebt to EBITDA: 1.31 fits within the Intermediate Risk category (2-3).\\nCFO to Debt: 0.23 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (25-35%).\\nFOCF to Debt: 0.11 aligns with the Significant Risk category (10-15%).\\nDCF to Debt: 0.11 corresponds to the Significant Risk category (10-15%).\\nFFO Cash Interest Cover: A ratio of 2.93 places it in the Intermediate Risk category (6-9).\\nEBITDA to Interest: With a ratio of 10.3, it falls within the Intermediate Risk category (6-10).\\n\\nConsidering the majority of the metrics are in the Intermediate Risk range, AAR Corp. is placed in the Intermediate Risk category overall.\\n\\nFinal Determination\\nBased on the analysis of financial metrics and alignment with the Standard volatility table, the financial risk profile of AAR Corp. is assessed as Intermediate Risk (3).\"}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# JSON Mode Text Generation:

follow a systematic approach based on the provided methodology. Let's break down the task into steps:\n","\n","  Determine the Volatility Category: Based on BDX's CICRA score of '2', we need to decide between the Standard, Medial, and Low volatility categories. Given the healthcare equipment sector's inherent characteristics and the company's specific financials, we should consider the operational volatility and guidelines provided.\n","\n","  Apply the Correct Financial Metrics and Categories: After establishing the volatility category, we'll apply the relevant financial metrics and categories to BDX's key financial ratios to ascertain the risk rating.\n","\n","  Step 1: Determine the Volatility Category\n","  Given BDX's CICRA score is '2', it initially suggests a potential fit for either the Medial or Standard volatility categories. However, because the company operates in the healthcare equipment sector, which typically exhibits lower volatility due to steady demand and regulatory barriers to entry, there's a rationale for considering the Low volatility table, especially if the healthcare sector's specific characteristics imply lower operational volatility for BDX.\n","\n","  CICRA Score: '2' suggests Medial volatility but can also fit Low volatility if operational volatility is expected to be low.\n","  Since the company's operational volatility isn't directly provided, we infer based on the sector characteristics. Healthcare equipment, being essential and regulated, likely has lower volatility. However, without explicit data on BDX's operational volatility or expectations of such, we proceed with caution, leaning towards Medial volatility due to the lack of explicit low volatility indicators and the CICRA score guidance.\n","\n","  Step 2: Apply Financial Metrics and Categories\n","  Given the uncertainty in operational volatility but considering the sector and CICRA score, we'll use the Medial Volatility Categories as a more conservative approach without explicit data suggesting otherwise. Now, let's match BDX's financial metrics to the Medial volatility risk categories:\n","\n","  FFO to Debt: 21% falls into the Significant Risk category (13-23%).\n","  Debt to EBITDA: 2.95 fits within the Intermediate Risk category (2.5-3.5).\n","  CFO to Debt: 21%, not directly comparable but similar to FFO to Debt, indicating Significant Risk.\n","  FOCF to Debt: 16%, which is closely aligned with the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%).\n","  DCF to Debt: 19%, closer to Intermediate Risk (6.5-11%).\n","  FFO Cash Interest Cover: 7.48, which places it in the Intermediate Risk category (5-7.5).\n","  EBITDA to Interest: 11, fitting the Intermediate Risk category (5-9).\n","  Considering the above metrics, BDX most frequently aligns with the Intermediate Risk and Significant Risk categories across different metrics. The dominant category would be determined by the majority of metrics falling within a specific range. Given the spread, BDX shows a blend of Intermediate and Significant Risk indicators.\n","\n","  However, since the decision between Intermediate and Significant Risk hinges on the broader context of operational stability, regulatory environment, and market position, which are inherently more stable in the healthcare equipment sector, the final judgment leans slightly towards the Intermediate Risk category as the more appropriate classification, acknowledging a borderline situation.\n","\n","  Final Determination\n","  Given the balanced approach and the slight inclination towards Medial volatility without strong evidence for Low volatility, combined with the metrics predominantly indicating an Intermediate Risk, the final rating for Becton, Dickinson and Company can be categorized as Intermediate Risk (3)\"\n","    }},\n","    \"volatility\": \"medial\"\n","    \"intermediate_steps\": {{\n","        \"ffo_to_debt\": {{\n","          \"answer\": \"[a single risk qualification from 1-6]\",\n","          \"reasoning\": \"21% falls into the Significant Risk category (13-23%)\"\n","            }},\n","        \"debt_to_ebitda\": {{\n","          \"answer\": \"Intermediate Risk\",\n","          \"reasoning\": \"2.95 fits within the Intermediate Risk category (2.5-3.5)\"\n","            }},\n","        \"cfo_to_debt\": {{\n","          \"answer\": \"Significant Risk\",\n","          \"reasoning\": \"21%, as 15-25 indicates Significant Risk\"\n","            }},\n","        \"focf_to_debt\": {{\n","          \"answer\": \"Significant Risk\",\n","          \"reasoning\": \"16%, which is closely aligned with the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%)\"\n","            }},\n","        \"dcf_to_debt\": {{\n","          \"answer\": \"Intermediate Risk\",\n","          \"reasoning\": \"19%, closer to Intermediate Risk (6.5-11%)\"\n","            }},\n","        \"ffo_cash_interest_cover\": {{\n","          \"answer\": \"Intermediate Risk\",\n","          \"reasoning\": \"7.48, which places it in the Intermediate Risk category (5-7.5)\"\n","            }},\n","        \"ebitda_to_interest\": {{\n","          \"answer\": \"Intermediate Risk\",\n","          \"reasoning\": \"11 fits the Intermediate Risk category (5-9)\"\n","            }}\n","    }},\n","  }}\"\"\")\n","\n","\n","def custom_prompt(row):\n","  return  f\"\"\"\n","  Your goal is to predict the S&P financial risk profile from 1-6 for {row['company_name']}.
