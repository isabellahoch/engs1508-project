methodological explanation as to why you chose that specific rating]\"}\\n\\n  Ensure that all strings are enclosed in double quotes.\\n\\n  For example:\\n\\n  {\"answer\": \"3\", \"reasoning\": \"To determine the financial risk profile for Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX), we need to follow a systematic approach based on the provided methodology. Let\\'s break down the task into steps:\\n\\n  Determine the Volatility Category: Based on BDX\\'s CICRA score of \\'2\\', we need to decide between the Standard, Medial, and Low volatility categories. Given the healthcare equipment sector\\'s inherent characteristics and the company\\'s specific financials, we should consider the operational volatility and guidelines provided.\\n\\n  Apply the Correct Financial Metrics and Categories: After establishing the volatility category, we\\'ll apply the relevant financial metrics and categories to BDX\\'s key financial ratios to ascertain the risk rating.\\n\\n  Step 1: Determine the Volatility Category\\n  Given BDX\\'s CICRA score is \\'2\\', it initially suggests a potential fit for either the Medial or Standard volatility categories. However, because the company operates in the healthcare equipment sector, which typically exhibits lower volatility due to steady demand and regulatory barriers to entry, there\\'s a rationale for considering the Low volatility table, especially if the healthcare sector\\'s specific characteristics imply lower operational volatility for BDX.\\n\\n  CICRA Score: \\'2\\' suggests Medial volatility but can also fit Low volatility if operational volatility is expected to be low.\\n  Since the company\\'s operational volatility isn\\'t directly provided, we infer based on the sector characteristics. Healthcare equipment, being essential and regulated, likely has lower volatility. However, without explicit data on BDX\\'s operational volatility or expectations of such, we proceed with caution, leaning towards Medial volatility due to the lack of explicit low volatility indicators and the CICRA score guidance.\\n\\n  Step 2: Apply Financial Metrics and Categories\\n  Given the uncertainty in operational volatility but considering the sector and CICRA score, we\\'ll use the Medial Volatility Categories as a more conservative approach without explicit data suggesting otherwise. Now, let\\'s match BDX\\'s financial metrics to the Medial volatility risk categories:\\n\\n  FFO to Debt: 21% falls into the Significant Risk category (13-23%).\\n  Debt to EBITDA: 2.95 fits within the Intermediate Risk category (2.5-3.5).\\n  CFO to Debt: 21%, not directly comparable but similar to FFO to Debt, indicating Significant Risk.\\n  FOCF to Debt: 16%, which is closely aligned with the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%).\\n  DCF to Debt: 19%, closer to Intermediate Risk (6.5-11%).\\n  FFO Cash Interest Cover: 7.48, which places it in the Intermediate Risk category (5-7.5).\\n  EBITDA to Interest: 11, fitting the Intermediate Risk category (5-9).\\n  Considering the above metrics, BDX most frequently aligns with the Intermediate Risk and Significant Risk categories across different metrics. The dominant category would be determined by the majority of metrics falling within a specific range. Given the spread, BDX shows a blend of Intermediate and Significant Risk indicators.\\n\\n  However, since the decision between Intermediate and Significant Risk hinges on the broader context of operational stability, regulatory environment, and market position, which are inherently more stable in the healthcare equipment sector, the final judgment leans slightly towards the Intermediate Risk category as the more appropriate classification, acknowledging a borderline situation.\\n\\n  Final Determination\\n  Given the balanced approach and the slight inclination towards Medial volatility without strong evidence for Low volatility, combined with the metrics predominantly indicating an Intermediate Risk, the final rating for Becton, Dickinson and Company can be categorized as Intermediate Risk (3)\"} [/INST]\\n\\nBased on the provided methodology and the given financial metrics for AAR Corp., let\\'s determine the financial risk profile:\\n\\nStep 1: Determine the Volatility Category\\nGiven AAR Corp.\\'s CICRA score of \\'3\\' and the Aerospace & Defense industry\\'s inherent characteristics, we need to decide between the Standard, Medial, and Low volatility categories. Since the Aerospace & Defense industry typically exhibits higher operational volatility due to factors like technological advancements, regulatory changes, and geopolitical risks, we should consider the Standard volatility category.\\n\\nStep 2: Apply Financial Metrics and Categories\\nNow, let\\'s match AAR Corp.\\'s financial metrics to the Standard Volatility Categories:\\n\\n1. FFO to debt: 0.18 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (13-23%).\\n2. Debt to EBITDA: 1.31 fits within the Significant Risk category (3.5-4.5).\\n3. FFO cash interest cover: 2.93 is within the Intermediate Risk category (5-7.5).\\n4. EBITDA to interest: 10.3 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (5-9).\\n5. CFO to debt: 0.23 falls within the Modest Risk category (27.5-40%).\\n6. FOCF to debt: 0.11 falls within the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%).\\n7. DCF to debt: 0.11 falls within the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%).\\n8. EBIT margin: 7.25 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (5-9%).\\n9. EBITDA margin: 8.7 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (5-9%).\\n10. Return on capital: 7.05 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (5-9%).\\n\\nBased on the financial metrics, AAR Corp. shows a mix of Intermediate and Significant Risk indicators.

According to the methodology, a company with an intermediate CICRA (3) can infrequently also apply to a low volatility table if it exhibits or is expected to exhibit low levels of volatility. However, without specific information about AAR Corp.\\'s volatility, we cannot definitively say whether it falls into this category.\\n\\nUsing the low volatility table, let\\'s evaluate AAR Corp.\\'s financial risk profile based on the given key financial metrics:\\n\\n1. FFO/Debt: 0.18 (below the minimum threshold of 35%)\\n2. Debt/EBITDA: 1.31 (within the range of 3-4)\\n3. FFO/Cash Interest: 2.93 (above the minimum threshold of 3)\\n4. EBITDA/Interest: 10.3 (above the minimum threshold of 13)\\n5. CFO/Debt: 0.23 (below the minimum threshold of 30%)\\n6. FOCF/Debt: 0.11 (below the minimum threshold of 20)\\n7. DCF/Debt: 0.11 (below the minimum threshold of 11)\\n8. EBIT margin: 7.25 (not specified in the low volatility table)\\n9. EBITDA margin: 8.7 (not specified in the low volatility table)\\n10. Return on capital: 7.05 (not specified in the low volatility table)\\n\\nBased on the given financial metrics, AAR Corp. does not meet the minimum thresholds for any of the minimal risk categories in the low volatility table. Therefore, it falls into the significant risk category (4).\\n\\nANSWER: 4.

According to the methodology, a company with an intermediate CICRA (3) can infrequently also apply to a low volatility table if it exhibits or is expected to exhibit low levels of volatility. However, without specific information about AAR Corp.\\'s volatility, we cannot definitively say whether it falls into this category.\\n\\nUsing the low volatility table, let\\'s evaluate AAR Corp.\\'s financial risk profile based on the given key financial metrics:\\n\\n1. FFO/Debt: 0.18 (below the minimum threshold of 35%)\\n2. Debt/EBITDA: 1.31 (within the range of 3-4)\\n3. FFO/Cash Interest: 2.93 (above the minimum threshold of 3)\\n4. EBITDA/Interest: 10.3 (above the minimum threshold of 13)\\n5. CFO/Debt: 0.23 (below the minimum threshold of 30%)\\n6. FOCF/Debt: 0.11 (below the minimum threshold of 20)\\n7. DCF/Debt: 0.11 (below the minimum threshold of 11)\\n8. EBIT margin: 7.25 (not specified in the low volatility table)\\n9. EBITDA margin: 8.7 (not specified in the low volatility table)\\n10. Return on capital: 7.05 (not specified in the low volatility table)\\n\\nBased on the given financial metrics, AAR Corp. does not meet the minimum thresholds for any of the minimal risk categories in the low volatility table. Therefore, it falls into the significant risk category (4).\\n\\nANSWER: 4.

following CICRA and industry:\\n\\n  CICRA: [3] Intermediate risk\\n  Industry: AEROSPACE & DEFENSE.\\n  Business description: AAR Corp. provides products and services to commercial aviation, government, and defense markets worldwide.\\n\\n  The low volatility table will generally apply when a company\\'s CICRA is \\'1\\' but can infrequently also apply to a company with a CICRA of \\'2\\' if the company exhibits or is expected to exhibit low levels of volatility.\\n  The medial volatility table will generally apply for a company with a CICRA of \\'2\\' but can infrequently also apply to a company with a CICRA of \\'1\\' if the company exhibits or is expected to exhibit medial levels of volatility.\\n  The standard volatility table serves as the relevant benchmark table for all CICRA scores other than \\'1\\', but we will always use it for companies with a CICRA of \\'1\\' or \\'2\\' whose competitive position is assessed as \\'5\\' or \\'6\\'.\\n\\n  Standard Volatility

return a JSON object with \\'answer\\' and \\'reasoning\\' fields.\\n\\n  Final answer should be in the following format:\\n  \\n  {\"answer\": \"[a single category from 1-6]\", \"reasoning\": \"[A methodological explanation as to why you chose that specific rating]\"}\\n\\n  Ensure that all strings are enclosed in double quotes.\\n\\n  For example:\\n\\n  {\"answer\": \"3\", \"reasoning\": \"To determine the financial risk profile for Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX), we need to follow a systematic approach based on the provided methodology. Let\\'s break down the task into steps:\\n\\n  Determine the Volatility Category: Based on BDX\\'s CICRA score of \\'2\\', we need to decide between the Standard, Medial, and Low volatility categories. Given the healthcare equipment sector\\'s inherent characteristics and the company\\'s specific financials, we should consider the operational volatility and guidelines provided.\\n\\n  Apply the Correct Financial Metrics and Categories: After establishing the volatility category, we\\'ll apply the relevant financial metrics and categories to BDX\\'s key financial ratios to ascertain the risk rating.\\n\\n  Step 1: Determine the Volatility Category\\n  Given BDX\\'s CICRA score is \\'2\\', it initially suggests a potential fit for either the Medial or Standard volatility categories. However, because the company operates in the healthcare equipment sector, which typically exhibits lower volatility due to steady demand and regulatory barriers to entry, there\\'s a rationale for considering the Low volatility table, especially if the healthcare sector\\'s specific characteristics imply lower operational volatility for BDX.\\n\\n  CICRA Score: \\'2\\' suggests Medial volatility but can also fit Low volatility if operational volatility is expected to be low.\\n  Since the company\\'s operational volatility isn\\'t directly provided, we infer based on the sector characteristics. Healthcare equipment, being essential and regulated, likely has lower volatility. However, without explicit data on BDX\\'s operational volatility or expectations of such, we proceed with caution, leaning towards Medial volatility due to the lack of explicit low volatility indicators and the CICRA score guidance.\\n\\n  Step 2: Apply Financial Metrics and Categories\\n  Given the uncertainty in operational volatility but considering the sector and CICRA score, we\\'ll use the Medial Volatility Categories as a more conservative approach without explicit data suggesting otherwise. Now, let\\'s match BDX\\'s financial metrics to the Medial volatility risk categories:\\n\\n  FFO to Debt: 21% falls into the Significant Risk category (13-23%).\\n  Debt to EBITDA: 2.95 fits within the Intermediate Risk category (2.5-3.5).\\n  CFO to Debt: 21%, not directly comparable but similar to FFO to Debt, indicating Significant Risk.\\n  FOCF to Debt: 16%, which is closely aligned with the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%).\\n  DCF to Debt: 19%, closer to Intermediate Risk (6.5-11%).\\n  FFO Cash Interest Cover: 7.48, which places it in the Intermediate Risk category (5-7.5).\\n  EBITDA to Interest: 11, fitting the Intermediate Risk category (5-9).\\n  Considering the above metrics, BDX most frequently aligns with the Intermediate Risk and Significant Risk categories across different metrics. The dominant category would be determined by the majority of metrics falling within a specific range. Given the spread, BDX shows a blend of Intermediate and Significant Risk indicators.\\n\\n  However, since the decision between Intermediate and Significant Risk hinges on the broader context of operational stability, regulatory environment, and market position, which are inherently more stable in the healthcare equipment sector, the final judgment leans slightly towards the Intermediate Risk category as the more appropriate classification, acknowledging a borderline situation.\\n\\n  Final Determination\\n  Given the balanced approach and the slight inclination towards Medial volatility without strong evidence for Low volatility, combined with the metrics predominantly indicating an Intermediate Risk, the final rating for Becton, Dickinson and Company can be categorized as Intermediate Risk (3)\"}\\n\\n  Based on the provided context and the methodology outlined, the financial risk profile for AAR Corp. can be determined as follows:\\n\\n  Step 1: Determine the Volatility Category\\n  AAR Corp.\\'s CICRA score is \\'3\\', which suggests Intermediate risk. However, the Aerospace & Defense industry is known for its high volatility due to factors like regulatory changes, geopolitical risks, and technological advancements. This industry typically falls under the Medial or High volatility categories.\\n\\n  Since the CICRA score is not definitive in this case, we need to consider the industry characteristics and the company\\'s financials to determine the volatility category.\\n\\n  Step 2: Apply Financial Metrics and Categories\\n  Given the uncertainty in operational volatility and the high volatility nature of the Aerospace & Defense industry, we\\'ll use the Medial Volatility Categories as a more conservative approach. Now, let\\'s match AAR Corp.\\'s financial metrics to the Medial volatility risk categories:\\n\\n  FFO to debt: 0.18 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (5-9%).\\n  Debt to EBITDA: 1.31 falls within the Significant Risk category (3.5-4.5).\\n  FFO cash interest cover: 2.93 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (5-7.5).\\n  EBITDA to interest: 10.3 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (5-9).\\n  CFO to debt: 0.23 falls within the Intermediate Risk category (18.5-27.5%).\\n  FOCF to debt: 0.11 falls within the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%).\\n  DCF to debt: 0.11 falls within the Significant Risk category (2.5-6.5).\\n\\n  Based on the financial metrics, AAR Corp. shows a mix of Intermediate and Significant Risk indicators. However, given the high volatility nature of the Aerospace & Defense industry, the final judgment leans slightly towards the Significant Risk category as the more appropriate classification.\\n\\n  Final Determination\\n  Given the high volatility nature of the Aerospace & Defense industry and the mix of Intermediate and Significant Risk indicators from AAR Corp.\\'s financial metrics, the final rating for AAR Corp. can be categorized as Significant Risk (5).'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":112}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain.invoke(custom_prompt(df.iloc[0]))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":347},"id":"J1Sz0iB8dNqU","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1709069167470,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":3361,"user":{"displayName":"Isabella Hochschild","userId":"06805518317930407108"}},"outputId":"0058984e-7679-459c-a1f2-c2bdc30f0147"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"RateLimitError","evalue":"Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

methodology. Let's break down the task into steps:\n","\n","  Determine the Volatility Category: Based on BDX's CICRA score of '2', we need to decide between the Standard, Medial, and Low volatility categories. Given the healthcare equipment sector's inherent characteristics and the company's specific financials, we should consider the operational volatility and guidelines provided.\n","\n","  Apply the Correct Financial Metrics and Categories: After establishing the volatility category, we'll apply the relevant financial metrics and categories to BDX's key financial ratios to ascertain the risk rating.\n","\n","  Step 1: Determine the Volatility Category\n","  Given BDX's CICRA score is '2', it initially suggests a potential fit for either the Medial or Standard volatility categories. However, because the company operates in the healthcare equipment sector, which typically exhibits lower volatility due to steady demand and regulatory barriers to entry, there's a rationale for considering the Low volatility table, especially if the healthcare sector's specific characteristics imply lower operational volatility for BDX.\n","\n","  CICRA Score: '2' suggests Medial volatility but can also fit Low volatility if operational volatility is expected to be low.\n","  Since the company's operational volatility isn't directly provided, we infer based on the sector characteristics. Healthcare equipment, being essential and regulated, likely has lower volatility. However, without explicit data on BDX's operational volatility or expectations of such, we proceed with caution, leaning towards Medial volatility due to the lack of explicit low volatility indicators and the CICRA score guidance.\n","\n","  Step 2: Apply Financial Metrics and Categories\n","  Given the uncertainty in operational volatility but considering the sector and CICRA score, we'll use the Medial Volatility Categories as a more conservative approach without explicit data suggesting otherwise. Now, let's match BDX's financial metrics to the Medial volatility risk categories:\n","\n","  FFO to Debt: 21% falls into the Significant Risk category (13-23%).\n","  Debt to EBITDA: 2.95 fits within the Intermediate Risk category (2.5-3.5).\n","  CFO to Debt: 21%, not directly comparable but similar to FFO to Debt, indicating Significant Risk.\n","  FOCF to Debt: 16%, which is closely aligned with the Significant Risk category (5-9.5%).\n","  DCF to Debt: 19%, closer to Intermediate Risk (6.5-11%).\n","  FFO Cash Interest Cover: 7.48, which places it in the Intermediate Risk category (5-7.5).\n","  EBITDA to Interest: 11, fitting the Intermediate Risk category (5-9).\n","  Considering the above metrics, BDX most frequently aligns with the Intermediate Risk and Significant Risk categories across different metrics. The dominant category would be determined by the majority of metrics falling within a specific range. Given the spread, BDX shows a blend of Intermediate and Significant Risk indicators.\n","\n","  However, since the decision between Intermediate and Significant Risk hinges on the broader context of operational stability, regulatory environment, and market position, which are inherently more stable in the healthcare equipment sector, the final judgment leans slightly towards the Intermediate Risk category as the more appropriate classification, acknowledging a borderline situation.\n","\n","  Final Determination\n","  Given the balanced approach and the slight inclination towards Medial volatility without strong evidence for Low volatility, combined with the metrics predominantly indicating an Intermediate Risk, the final rating for Becton, Dickinson and Company can be categorized as Intermediate Risk (3)\"}}\"\"\")\n","\n","\n","def custom_prompt(row):\n","  return  f\"\"\"\n","  Your goal is to predict the S&P financial risk profile from 1-6 for {row['company_name']}.

let's conduct a step-by-step analysis to predict the S&P financial risk profile for Boeing Co.\\n\\n**Step 1: Determine the Correct Volatility Table**\\n\\n- Boeing's CICRA is [3], which is categorized as Intermediate Risk.\\n- Boeing operates within the Aerospace & Defense industry.\\n\\nSince Boeing's CICRA is [3], we'll not use the low volatility table (applied generally to CICRA '1' and sometimes '2'). Instead, we should use the standard volatility table as the instructions suggest it is the relevant benchmark for all CICRA scores other than '1', and specifically for cases like Boeing's where the CICRA is [3].\\n\\n**Step 2: Industry-Specific Supplemental Ratios and Guidelines**\\n\\nThe specific question does not provide detailed industry-specific supplemental ratios and guidelines beyond what has been mentioned. Aerospace & Defense is known for high capital expenditure and R&D costs, which are crucial for companies like Boeing. As there are no further detailed guidelines provided for the Aerospace & Defense sector in the question, we proceed with the general methodology for determining Boeing's financial risk using the standard volatility table.\\n\\n**Step 3: Applying Financial Metrics to Determine Financial Risk Profile**\\n\\nLet's apply Boeing's financial metrics to the standard volatility table to determine its risk profile.\\n\\n- FFO to debt: 0.11 (11%) - Falls into the \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\" range.\\n- Debt to EBITDA: 10.6 - Exceeds the \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\" threshold.\\n- FFO cash interest cover: 2.42 - Within the \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\" range.\\n- EBITDA to interest: 1.47 - Falls into \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\"\\n- CFO to debt: 0.16 (16%) - Edges into the \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\" category.\\n- FOCF to debt: 0.12 (12%) - Also \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\".\\n- DCF to debt: 0.13 (13%) - Fits within the \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\" indicators.\\n\\nThe key financial metrics provided for Boeing all indicate a financial risk profile that falls within the \\\"Highly Leveraged\\\" category according to the standard volatility table. Even without specific industry ratios from the knowledge base, Boeing's metrics clearly point towards significant leverage concerns based on debt ratios, cash flow capabilities, and interest coverage.\\n\\n**ANSWER: 6 (Highly Leveraged).**\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":68}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df[:10]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":748},"id":"v5ly8739oRDD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709071997866,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":142,"user":{"displayName":"Isabella Hochschild","userId":"06805518317930407108"}},"outputId":"b80fd630-6981-41e4-bfa1-c653ae44b661"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Unnamed: 0                        company_name               sector  \\\n","0           0                           AAR Corp.

According to the methodology, a company with an intermediate CICRA (3) and an aerospace and defense industry typically uses the low volatility table. However, the CICRA alone does not definitively determine the volatility table to use. The methodology also states that the low volatility table may apply to a company with a CICRA of \\'2\\' if the company exhibits or is expected to exhibit low levels of volatility. In this case, we do not have enough information to determine if BWX Technologies exhibits low levels of volatility. Therefore, we cannot definitively say which volatility table to use.\\n\\nSince we cannot definitively determine which volatility table to use, we cannot proceed to the next steps of locating industry-specific guidelines and applying financial metrics to determine the financial risk profile.

Given the CICRA score of [3] (Intermediate risk) for AAR Corp. and its industry (AEROSPACE & DEFENSE), we should use the Standard Volatility Table. This decision is based on the guidelines that the standard volatility table is used for all CICRA scores other than '1,' and considering AAR Corp.'s CICRA score and its industry, it doesn't align with the criteria for using the low or medial volatility tables exclusively.\\n\\nMoving onto STEP 2, unfortunately, there were no specific supplemental ratios and guidelines provided for the aerospace & defense industry within the instructions. Therefore, we proceed with the general methodology without industry-specific adjustments.\\n\\nIn STEP 3, we apply the key financial metrics of AAR Corp. to the Standard Volatility Table to determine its financial risk profile:\\n\\n1. FFO to debt is 18% (0.18), which aligns with the Aggressive Risk category.\\n2. Debt to EBITDA is 1.31, which would typically indicate a Modest Risk profile. However, all factors must meet the criteria to fall into a less risky category.\\n3. FFO cash interest cover is 2.93, fitting the Aggressive Risk category.\\n4. EBITDA to interest is 10.3, aligning with the Modest Risk category.\\n5. CFO to debt is 23% (0.23), which indicates a Significant Risk profile.\\n6. FOCF to debt is 11% (0.11), which also fits into the Significant Risk category.\\n7. DCF to debt is 11% (0.11), aligning with the Significant Risk profile.\\n\\nGiven these metrics, we see some spread across the categories, but the dominant determinants (FFO to debt, FFO cash interest cover) point towards a higher risk level. Despite some ratios pointing towards less risk (notably Debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest), the financial risk profile is determined by the weakest links, which in this case are the metrics that align with Aggressive and Significant Risk categories.\\n\\nConsidering the preponderance of metrics falling into the Aggressive and Significant Risk profiles, and with a more weighted concern towards the ratios that indicate liquidity and ability to service debt (FFO to debt, FFO cash interest cover), the profile seems to lean more towards an Aggressive Risk profile, but it is crucial to recognize it doesn't fully align with being Highly Leveraged.\\n\\nThus, taking into account the spread and giving precedence to ratios that showcase immediate financial health and risk (such as FFO to debt and FFO cash interest cover), the most fitting categorization appears to be:\\n\\nANSWER: Aggressive Risk [5].\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":65}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["output['answer']"],"metadata":{"id":"709YCWT6Z3SJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709068220808,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":141,"user":{"displayName":"Isabella Hochschild","userId":"06805518317930407108"}},"outputId":"8e71d479-fc68-43d6-c221-0af27a1515a0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":482}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Given the information provided and following the methodology outlined, let\\'s determine the financial risk profile for CACI International Inc. step by step.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine the Volatility Table\\n\\nCACI International Inc. has a CICRA of [3] which indicates an \\'Intermediate risk\\' level. Based on the information, the aerospace and defense industry typically suggests a potential for varying levels of volatility, but not necessarily low. Given that the company\\'s CICRA is \\'3\\' and considering no specific low volatility indicators were mentioned explicitly for the company\\'s operational or financial characteristics, we opt for the **Standard Volatility Table** as the starting point. This choice is guided by the instructions which indicate that the standard volatility table serves as the relevant benchmark table for all CICRA scores other than \\'1\\'.\\n\\n### Step 2: Industry-Specific Supplemental Ratios\\n\\nThe task didn\\'t specifically list industry-specific supplemental ratios for aerospace and defense. Therefore, we proceed with the general guidelines provided for assessing financial risk without additional adjustments or considerations for industry-specific factors outside the standard financial metrics. That said, the aerospace and defense industry generally involves high capital expenditures and can have substantial government contracts, which might affect FOCF and DCF positively but doesn\\'t directly alter the standard methodology for determining the financial risk profile.\\n\\n### Step 3: Apply Financial Metrics\\n\\nNow, we match CACI International Inc.\\'s financial metrics against the standards provided by the Standard Volatility Table:\\n\\n1. **FFO to Debt: 15%** falls into the \"Highly Leveraged\" category (>12%).\\n2. **Debt to EBITDA: 2.42** places it in the \"Intermediate Risk\" category (2-3).\\n3. **FFO cash interest cover: 3.2** aligns with \"Significant Risk\" (4-6).\\n4. **EBITDA to interest: 8.06** suggests \"Significant Risk\" (3-6).\\n5. **CFO to debt: 17%** indicates \"Significant Risk\" (15-25%).\\n6. **FOCF to debt: 13%** aligns with \"Significant Risk\" (10-15%).\\n7. **DCF to debt: 36%** exceeds the boundaries set in the provided table, suggesting better performance in this area.\\n\\nAnalyzing these metrics, four out of the seven key indicators used for determining the financial risk profile place CACI International Inc. in the \"Significant Risk\" category.

the company's associated industry and country risk volatility, also known as CICRA. This involves determining the industry (in this case, Aerospace and Defense) and the country where AAR Corp. primarily operates. The CICRA will give you an initial understanding of the external risks associated with the company's operational environment.\\n\\n2. **Select Volatility Table**: Based on the CICRA, select the appropriate volatility table. Each industry and country combination will have its specific risk volatility table that outlines how external factors might influence financial stability and performance.\\n\\n3. **Assess Financial Metrics**: Review AAR Corp.'s financial statements and extract key financial metrics that are specific to the aerospace and defense industry. This might involve looking at supplemental ratios and other financial indicators that are critical for assessing a company's financial health within this sector. The Key Credit Factors article for Aerospace and Defense would provide guidance on which metrics are most relevant.\\n\\n4. **Apply Metrics to Volatility Table**: Once you have the relevant financial metrics, apply these figures to the selected volatility table.

These scores reflect the credit risk of operating within these countries and can impact the company\\'s financial risk profile.\\n\\n2. **Industry Analysis**: Understand the specific industry dynamics that AAR Corp. operates within.

These ratios provide insight into the company\\'s financial health, efficiency, and risk levels.\\n\\n4. **Assessment of Financial Risk Profile**: Using the gathered data, analyze AAR Corp.\\'s financial risk profile. This involves comparing the company\\'s metrics against industry benchmarks and the specifics outlined in \"table 3\" (which is not provided here but presumably includes criteria or thresholds for determining the financial risk profile levels from 1 to 6).\\n\\n5. **Determine the Anchor**: The \"anchor\" likely refers to a baseline or starting point for the assessment.

While I can't provide a dynamic or real-time prediction, I can outline the general steps based on the methodology components you've provided:\\n\\n1. **CICRA Assessment**: Start by evaluating AAR Corp.'s exposure to its industry and country risk volatility. This involves understanding the aviation and aerospace sector's risk profile and the economic and political stability of the country or countries in which AAR Corp operates. The CICRA will help in determining the baseline risk associated with the industry and geographical location.\\n\\n2. **Industry Characteristics**: Analyze the specific characteristics of the aerospace and defense industry, including market growth, cyclicality, competitive dynamics, and regulatory environment. This step is crucial because it provides context for AAR Corp.'s operational risks and opportunities.\\n\\n3. **Financial Metrics Analysis**: Gather AAR Corp.'s financial data, focusing on key credit ratios and other relevant financial metrics. According to the methodology, you should use the arithmetic mean of these credit ratios to get a standardized view of the company's financial health. Important ratios may include debt-to-equity, interest coverage, EBITDA margin, and others relevant to assessing financial risk.\\n\\n4. **Volatility Tables**: Depending on the CICRA and industry characteristics, decide whether to use standard, medial, or low volatility tables. These tables are designed to adjust the financial risk profile based on the inherent volatility of the company's earnings and cash flows, which can be influenced by both industry and country risk factors. For a company like AAR Corp., which operates in an industry that can be subject to significant cyclical and geopolitical risks, the choice of volatility table is critical.\\n\\n5. **Rating Determination**: After analyzing CICRA, industry characteristics, and financial metrics, and determining the appropriate volatility adjustment, integrate these insights to predict the financial risk profile rating.

While I can't access real-time or company-specific data, I can outline the general process you'd undertake based on the methodology components you've mentioned, such as assessing volatility tables based on CICRA (Country Industry and Risk Assessment) and industry, analyzing key financial metrics, and considering industry-specific guidelines. Here’s how you might approach it:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Corporate Ratings Framework**: First, familiarize yourself with the S&P corporate ratings framework. This framework provides a comprehensive method for evaluating a company's creditworthiness, which includes financial risk profile assessment among other factors.\\n\\n2. **Identify the Relevant CICRA and Industry**: Determine AAR Corp.'s industry classification and the relevant Country Industry and Risk Assessment (CICRA) level. The CICRA provides a context of the economic and industry risks within which AAR Corp. operates. This step is crucial as it influences the volatility table you'll use for further analysis.\\n\\n3. **Select the Correct Volatility Table**: Based on AAR Corp.'s industry and the associated CICRA level, select the appropriate volatility table. This table is instrumental in understanding the potential variability in AAR Corp.'s financial performance, which is a key factor in assessing financial risk.\\n\\n4. **Analyze Key Financial Metrics**: Examine AAR Corp.'s key financial metrics, such as leverage (debt-to-equity ratio), liquidity ratios, cash flow stability, profitability, and interest coverage ratios. These metrics provide insight into the company's financial health and resilience.\\n\\n5. **Apply Industry-Specific Guidelines**: Incorporate industry-specific guidelines into your analysis. Different industries have unique risk profiles and operational characteristics that must be considered when assessing a company's financial risk. For AAR Corp., focus on guidelines relevant to its sector, which could include factors like contract stability, regulatory environment, and cyclicality.\\n\\n6. **Determine the Financial Risk Profile Rating**: After thoroughly analyzing the data and considering the industry-specific factors, you can then determine AAR Corp.'s financial risk profile rating on the S&P scale of 1-6. A lower number typically indicates a lower financial risk, while a higher number suggests greater risk.\\n\\n7. **Review and Adjust**: Finally, review the entire assessment for consistency and accuracy. Adjust the financial risk profile rating if new information or insights suggest a different risk level is more appropriate.\\n\\nPlease note, this process requires access to detailed financial data, industry reports, and the specific methodologies used by S&P, including the definitions of each rating level and the precise metrics used to evaluate them.

Here's a simplified overview of how this might be approached, keeping in mind that actual rating methodologies are complex, involve qualitative judgments, and require access to detailed financial data:\\n\\n1. **Identify Industry and Country Risk (CICRA):** The first step is to determine the industry classification of BWX Technologies Inc. and assess the country risk where the company primarily operates. The industry classification might influence the risk profile due to sector-specific volatilities, while the country risk could add another layer of risk due to economic, political, or regulatory factors.\\n\\n2. **Collect Financial Metrics and Supplemental Ratios:** Key financial metrics such as debt-to-EBITDA, interest coverage ratios, free operating cash flow to debt, and profitability metrics are vital. These metrics provide insight into the company's ability to service its debt, generate cash flow, and maintain operational efficiency. Supplemental ratios might include liquidity ratios, cash conversion cycles, and leverage ratios.\\n\\n3. **Analyze Financial Risk Profile:** With the financial data in hand, analyze BWX Technologies Inc.'s financial risk profile. This involves assessing the stability and sustainability of its cash flows, the adequacy of its earnings to cover interest and operational expenses, its capital structure, and its liquidity position. This step may also involve comparing these metrics against industry benchmarks or historical performance to understand the company's position within its sector.\\n\\n4. **Apply the Corporate Ratings Framework:** Utilizing the S&P Corporate Ratings Framework or a similar methodology, integrate the findings from the financial analysis with the CICRA score and industry classification. The framework typically involves a combination of quantitative analysis, using the collected financial metrics, and qualitative judgment, considering factors such as management quality, competitive position, and market conditions.\\n\\n5. **Consideration of Volatility Tables:** Volatility tables, which provide data on historical and projected volatilities for various industries and countries, can help in adjusting the risk assessment for BWX Technologies Inc. based on expected future conditions in its operating environments. This might involve adjusting the financial risk profile rating for higher or lower expected volatility.\\n\\n6. **Final Rating Determination:** After integrating all these elements—CICRA score, financial metrics, industry classification, and volatility adjustments—a final financial risk profile rating can be estimated for BWX Technologies Inc.
