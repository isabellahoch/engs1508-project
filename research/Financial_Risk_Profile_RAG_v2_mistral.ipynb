This is because the company has a CICRA score of 4, which falls between the '1' and '2' range where the Medial Volatility Table is applicable, and there is no indication that the company exhibits or is expected to exhibit low levels of volatility. Therefore, the Medial Volatility Table should be used to assess the financial risk profile of Forum Energy Technologies Inc.\\n # STEP 2 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the provided context, let's categorize the financial metrics of Forum Energy Technologies Inc. using the Medial Volatility Table:\\n\\nCore Financial Metrics:\\n1. FFO to debt: 0.06 (Significant Risk: FFO/Debt between 13% and 23%)\\n2. Debt to EBITDA: 2.38 (Intermediate Risk: Debt/EBITDA between 2.5 and 3.5)\\n\\nSupplemental financial metrics:\\n1. FFO cash interest cover: 0.55 (Aggressive Risk: FFO/Cash Interest between 1.75 and 3)\\n2. EBITDA to interest: 3.01 (Intermediate Risk: EBITDA/Interest between 5 and 9)\\n3. CFO to debt: 0.05 (Aggressive Risk: CFO/Debt between 7% and 10.5%)\\n4. FOCF to debt: 0.01 (Highly Leveraged: FOCF/Debt less than 0)\\n5. DCF to debt: 0.05 (Aggressive Risk: DCF/Debt between -11 and 2.5)\\n\\nOther metrics:\\n1. EBIT margin: 2.83 (not provided in the volatility table)\\n2. EBITDA margin: 7.51 (not provided in the volatility table)\\n3. Return on capital: 2.22 (not provided in the volatility table)\\n4. CICRA: 4 (Moderately high risk, which aligns with the Aggressive Risk category)\\n\\nBased on these categorizations, Forum Energy Technologies Inc. shows signs of financial risk in multiple areas, including FFO to debt, FFO cash interest cover, EBITDA to interest, CFO to debt, and DCF to debt. The company's CICRA score of 4 also indicates a moderately high risk. It is essential to monitor these metrics closely and consider implementing strategies to mitigate financial risk.\\n # STEP 3 OUTPUT:\\n For the Oil & Gas Drilling, Equipment & Services industry, the sector-specific guidance suggests that the following supplemental ratios are important in addition to core ratios for understanding the credit risk profile and refining cash flow analysis:\\n\\n1. FOCF (Funds from Operations before changes in working capital) to debt: This ratio is preferred as it includes the effects from working capital and capital expenditure cycles, which significantly shape these companies' cash flow generation patterns.\\n\\n2. Operating cash flow to debt: This ratio may be used if a company has a Capital Expenditure to Gross Property, Plant, and Equipment (CPGP) of capital/asset focus or generally stable capital spending needs, considering the company's higher Research and Development (R&D) spending and lower cyclicality of capital spending requirements.\\n\\n3. Discretionary cash flow to debt: This ratio can be used for companies that pay dividends to shareholders, where such dividends are considered a material portion of cash flows.\\n\\nThese ratios help assess the financial risk profile of companies in the Oil & Gas Drilling, Equipment & Services industry, taking into account historical data and future forecasts based on price assumptions for oil and natural gas prices.\\n # STEP 4 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the information provided and following the steps outlined, let's determine the financial risk profile for Forum Energy Technologies Inc.\\n\\nStep 4A: Comparing core ratios\\n- FFO to debt: 0.06, which falls in the 'Significant Risk' category (FFO/Debt between 13% and 23%)\\n- Debt to EBITDA: 2.38, which falls in the 'Intermediate Risk' category (Debt/EBITDA between 2.5 and 3.5)\\n\\nBased on the industry-specific guidance, we will focus on FFO to debt as the best indicator of a company's future leverage.\\n\\nStep 4B: Considering supplementary ratios\\n- FFO cash interest cover: 0.55, which falls in the 'Aggressive Risk' category (FFO/Cash Interest between 1.75 and 3)\\n- EBITDA to interest: 3.01, which falls in the 'Intermediate Risk' category (EBITDA/Interest between 5 and 9)\\n- CFO to debt: 0.05, which falls in the 'Aggressive Risk' category (CFO/Debt between 7% and 10.5%)\\n- FOCF to debt: 0.01, which falls in the 'Highly Leveraged' category (FOCF/Debt less than 0)\\n- DCF to debt: 0.05, which falls in the 'Aggressive Risk' category (DCF/Debt between -11 and 2.5)\\n\\nBased on the industry-specific guidance, FOCF to debt is the most important supplemental ratio for the Oil & Gas Drilling, Equipment & Services industry. The company's FOCF to debt ratio is 0.01, which falls in the 'Highly Leveraged' category.\\n\\nSince the core ratio (FFO to debt) and the most important supplemental ratio (FOCF to debt) both fall in the 'Aggressive Risk' and 'Highly Leveraged' categories, respectively, we will adjust the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment in the direction of the cash flow/leverage assessment indicated by the supplemental ratio.\\n\\nTherefore, the financial risk profile for Forum Energy Technologies Inc. is 5, 'Aggressive'.\\n # STEP 5 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the analysis of Forum Energy Technologies Inc.'s financial metrics using the Medial Volatility Table and industry-specific guidance for the Oil & Gas Drilling, Equipment & Services industry, the company's core ratio (FFO to debt) and the most important supplemental ratio (FOCF to debt) both fall in the 'Aggressive Risk' and 'Highly Leveraged' categories, respectively. Therefore, the financial risk profile for Forum Energy Technologies Inc. is 5, 'Aggressive'.\\n\\nHere is the JSON object:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"The company's FFO to debt ratio is 0.06, which falls in the 'Significant Risk' category, and its FOCF to debt ratio is 0.01, which falls in the 'Highly Leveraged' category. Given that both core and supplemental ratios indicate a high level of financial risk, the overall financial risk profile for Forum Energy Technologies Inc. is rated as 'Aggressive' (5).\\\",\\n  \\\"answer\\\": 5\\n}\\n```\",\n          \"# STEP 1 OUTPUT:\\n\\n   Based on the information provided, the correct volatility table to use for Tri Pointe Homes Inc. is the standard volatility table (table 17). This is because the CICRA score for Tri Pointe Homes Inc. is 4, which falls under the category of 'all CICRA scores other than '1''. Additionally, there is no indication that the company exhibits or is expected to exhibit low or medium levels of volatility, which could warrant the use of the low or medium volatility tables. Therefore, the standard volatility table (table 17) is the most appropriate benchmark table to use for Tri Pointe Homes Inc.\\n # STEP 2 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the provided context, let's categorize the financial metrics of Tri Pointe Homes Inc. using the Standard Volatility Table:\\n\\nCore Financial Metrics:\\n1. FFO to debt: 0.13 -> Significant Risk (FFO/Debt is between 20% and 30%)\\n2. Debt to EBITDA: 1.24 -> Intermediate Risk (Debt/EBITDA is between 2 and 3)\\n\\nSupplemental financial metrics:\\n1. FFO cash interest cover: nan -> We cannot categorize this as we don't have a value.\\n2. EBITDA to interest: nan -> We cannot categorize this as we don't have a value.\\n3. CFO to debt: 0.33 -> Modest Risk (CFO/Debt is between 35% and 50%)\\n4. FOCF to debt: 0.29 -> Modest Risk (FOCF/Debt is between 25% and 40%)\\n5. DCF to debt: 0.6 -> Modest Risk (DCF/Debt is between 15% and 25%)\\n\\nOther metrics:\\n1. EBIT margin: 11.9 -> We cannot categorize this as it's not a metric in the table.\\n2. EBITDA margin: 12.6 -> We cannot categorize this as it's not a metric in the table.\\n3. Return on capital: 6.3 -> We cannot categorize this as it's not a metric in the table.\\n4. CICRA: [4] Moderately high risk -> This is a risk assessment score, not a metric in the table.\\n\\nPlease note that the categorization is based on the available data and the Standard Volatility Table. Some metrics couldn't be categorized due to the lack of data or because they are not part of the table.\\n # STEP 3 OUTPUT:\\n The documents provided do not contain specific guidance for the Homebuilders & Developers industry. However, they do provide information on how sector-specific guidance is used in determining the financial risk profile assessment and the supplemental ratios for the Building Materials Industry.\\n\\nIn general, sector-specific guidance involves using unique industry characteristics to adjust a company's financial metrics. These adjustments are consistent with four adjustment principles and can be routine or situational.\\n\\nFor the Building Materials Industry, the supplemental ratios considered important include:\\n1. Cash flow from operations (CFO) to debt\\n2. Free Operating Cash Flow (FOCF) to debt\\n3. EBITDA to interest\\n\\nThese ratios are used to assess the financial health of companies in the Building Materials Industry, taking into account their large sources and uses of cash, capex requirements, and other obligations.\\n\\nGiven the similarities between the Building Materials Industry and the Homebuilders & Developers industry, it can be inferred that similar supplemental and core metrics would be important for the Homebuilders & Developers industry. These might include various cash flow and leverage ratios, as well as metrics related to the industry's specific characteristics, such as land acquisition costs, construction costs, and sales of developed properties. However, this is an inference based on the available information and not a direct statement from the provided documents.\\n # STEP 4 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the information provided, let's proceed with Step 4 to determine the financial risk profile for Tri Pointe Homes Inc.\\n\\nStep 4A: Comparing Core Ratios\\n1. FFO to debt: 0.13 -> Significant Risk\\n2. Debt to EBITDA: 1.24 -> Intermediate Risk\\n\\nThe FFO to debt ratio suggests a higher risk profile compared to the Debt to EBITDA ratio. Therefore, we will use the FFO to debt ratio as the primary indicator of future leverage, which falls under the 'Significant Risk' category.\\n\\nStep 4B: Considering Supplementary Ratios\\nWe are missing some of the required data for the supplemental ratios. However, based on the available information, we can consider the following:\\n\\n1. CFO to debt: 0.33 -> Modest Risk\\n2. FOCF to debt: 0.29 -> Modest Risk\\n3. DCF to debt: 0.6 -> Modest Risk\\n\\nThese supplemental ratios indicate a 'Modest Risk' profile, which is lower than the 'Significant Risk' suggested by the FFO to debt ratio. However, since the FFO to debt ratio is a better indicator of future leverage for the Homebuilders & Developers industry, we will stick with the 'Significant Risk' assessment.\\n\\nTherefore, the final financial risk profile for Tri Pointe Homes Inc. is a 'Significant Risk' (4 out of 6).\\n # STEP 5 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the information provided and the methodology followed in steps 1-4, here is the final JSON object:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"The financial risk profile for Tri Pointe Homes Inc. was determined by first categorizing the company's financial metrics using the Standard Volatility Table. The core financial metric FFO to debt fell under the 'Significant Risk' category, while the Debt to EBITDA ratio was 'Intermediate Risk'. As FFO to debt is a better indicator of future leverage for the Homebuilders & Developers industry, we used this as the primary indicator, resulting in a 'Significant Risk' profile. Supplemental ratios indicated a 'Modest Risk', but this was lower than the 'Significant Risk' suggested by the FFO to debt ratio. Therefore, the final financial risk profile for Tri Pointe Homes Inc. is a 'Significant Risk' (4 out of 6).\\\",\\n  \\\"answer\\\": 4\\n}\\n```\",\n          \"# STEP 1 OUTPUT:\\n\\n   Based on the provided information, the appropriate volatility table to use for Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc. is the standard volatility table (table 17). This is because the company's CICRA score is '3' (Intermediate risk), which does not fall under the '1' or '2' categories for which the low or medial volatility tables would be used. Additionally, there is no information provided about the company's competitive position that would require the use of the low or medial volatility tables. Therefore, the standard volatility table (table 17) is the most appropriate benchmark table for this company.\\n # STEP 2 OUTPUT:\\n Sure, I can help you categorize the financial metrics of Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc. based on the provided volatility tables. Here's the classification:\\n\\nCore Financial Metrics:\\n\\n1. FFO to debt: 0.4 - Significant Risk (between 0.20 and 0.30)\\n2. Debt to EBITDA: 2.76 - Intermediate Risk (between 2 and 3)\\n\\nSupplemental financial metrics:\\n\\n1. FFO cash interest cover: 9.06 - Modest Risk (between 7.5 and 10.5)\\n2. EBITDA to interest: 7.15 - Intermediate Risk (between 5 and 7)\\n3. CFO to debt: 0.46 - Intermediate Risk (between 0.25 and 0.35)\\n4. FOCF to debt: 0.35 - Intermediate Risk (between 0.15 and 0.25)\\n5. DCF to debt: 0.46 - Intermediate Risk (between 0.10 and 0.15)\\n\\nOther metrics:\\n\\n1. EBIT margin: 14.7 - Not provided in the tables\\n2. EBITDA margin: 18.0 - Not provided in the tables\\n3. Return on capital: 8.64 - Not provided in the tables\\n4. CICRA: [3] Intermediate risk - This is a categorization, not a metric, and it's already given as intermediate risk.\\n\\nPlease note that the EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and Return on capital are not provided in the tables, so I couldn't classify them.\\n # STEP 3 OUTPUT:\\n The Building Materials industry has specific supplemental ratios used to assess its financial risk profile. These include Cash flow from operations (CFO) to debt, FOCF (Free Operating Cash Flow) to debt, and EBITDA to interest. CFO to debt is considered the most relevant due to significant working capital fluctuations. FOCF to debt is used for heavy material companies with sustained curtailment in capex during low capacity utilization. EBITDA to interest is used when the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment is significant or weaker. These ratios are chosen based on the company's fit into the Building Materials sector description and the specific core and supplemental ratios applicable to this sector.\\n # STEP 4 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the information provided, let's go through the steps to determine the financial risk profile for Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.\\n\\nStep 4A: Comparing core ratios to the benchmark table, we have:\\n- FFO to debt: 0.4, which falls into the 'Significant Risk' category (between 0.20 and 0.30).\\n- Debt to EBITDA: 2.76, which falls into the 'Intermediate Risk' category (between 2 and 3).\\n\\nBased on the industry-specific guidance, we should select FFO to debt as the relevant core ratio since it is the best indicator of a company's future leverage in the Building Materials industry.\\n\\nStep 4B: Now, let's consider the supplementary ratios:\\n- FFO cash interest cover: 9.06, which falls into the 'Modest Risk' category (between 7.5 and 10.5).\\n- EBITDA to interest: 7.15, which falls into the 'Intermediate Risk' category (between 5 and 7).\\n- CFO to debt: 0.46, which falls into the 'Intermediate Risk' category (between 0.25 and 0.35).\\n- FOCF to debt: 0.35, which falls into the 'Intermediate Risk' category (between 0.15 and 0.25).\\n- DCF to debt: 0.46, which falls into the 'Intermediate Risk' category (between 0.10 and 0.15).\\n\\nAccording to the industry-specific guidance, CFO to debt is the most relevant supplemental ratio for the Building Materials industry. Since the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment (FFO to debt) and the supplemental ratio (CFO to debt) both fall into the 'Intermediate Risk' category, no adjustment is needed.\\n\\nTherefore, the financial risk profile for Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc. is determined to be an 'Intermediate Risk', which corresponds to a risk profile assessment of 3.\\n # STEP 5 OUTPUT:\\n Based on the information provided and the steps followed to determine the financial risk profile of Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc., the final answer is:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"The financial risk profile for Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc. was determined by first identifying the appropriate volatility table (standard volatility table) and categorizing each financial metric. The core financial metrics were found to be FFO to debt (Significant Risk) and Debt to EBITDA (Intermediate Risk). Considering the industry-specific guidance, FFO to debt was selected as the most relevant core ratio. The supplemental ratios were then evaluated, with CFO to debt being the most relevant for the Building Materials industry. Both the preliminary cash flow/leverage assessment (FFO to debt) and the supplemental ratio (CFO to debt) fell into the 'Intermediate Risk' category, leading to an overall financial risk profile assessment of 3 (Intermediate Risk).\\\",\\n  \\\"answer\\\": 3\\n}\\n```\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}],"source":["df[['y_pred', 'financial_risk_profile', 'reasoning']].head(871)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from IPython.display import Markdown, display\n","display(Markdown(df['reasoning'].iloc[14]))"],"metadata":{"id":"rji-MKskstZs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.to_csv(\"/content/drive/Shareddrives/ENGS Final Project/Models/Output/RAW_PARTIAL_RESULTS_rag_v2_mistral.csv\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":162},"id":"n8Jq3fnLF5Iq","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1709352503145,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":155,"user":{"displayName":"Jack Friedman","userId":"00915674742915103531"}},"outputId":"eb8bbd7a-4f0c-42bd-d43d-393e9f823724"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'df' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-3-81719e494b5b>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 1>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mdf\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mto_csv\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"/content/drive/Shareddrives/ENGS Final Project/Models/Output/RAW_PARTIAL_RESULTS_rag_v2_mistral.csv\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'df' is not defined"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"5Q0LOnKchL2b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
